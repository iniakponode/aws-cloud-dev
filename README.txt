Deploy Static Website on AWS

In this project, you will deploy a static website to AWS using S3, CloudFront, and IAM.

The files included are: 

index.html - The Index document for the website.
/img - The background image file for the website.
/vendor - Bootssrap CSS framework, Font, and JavaScript libraries needed for the website to function.
/css - CSS files for the website.

The PDF document contains the images with labels of each stage of the project, but individual screenshots are also added in the zipp this folder for each stage of the project, incase those in the pdf document are not clear enough.
Thank you
